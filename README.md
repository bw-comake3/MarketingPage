# Co-Make

---

Below is the guidelines for the marketing page project side of Co-Make.
Inside this github you will find the Landing page html, along with some reporting examples html, about us html, and a basic form results page.
I used less for this project. The css files are there too if less is not your thing.
Less consists of the reset "normalize", index that routes all the other less files, mixins, variables, navigation, footer, global, landing page, about us, and reporting examples.
The latter three files in the list are corresponding to each individiual html file, with the form page being the exception. ###Reporting examples less contains the form page.

# MarketingPage

Ever get frustrated that a problem in your town or neighborhood goes ages without being resolved?
You might have road issues (potholes, dangerous areas..), overgrown plant issues, or anything else that makes living where you live a little less pleasant.
With Co-make you can make your voice heard on the issues you would like to see resolved in your community.

---

3 simple steps:
Describe the problem.
Other locals upvote the problem.
Problems with the most upvote get prioritized by local government or HOAâ€™s to be resolved first.

---

As well as seeing real change in your community you get rewards for being a positive community member in the form of points, freebies and local recognition.

The problem we are solving: the disintegration in the relationship between local government and the people they represent. The feeling of apathy many have towards local issues. The inability of local government to reach and listen to their constituents effectively.
MVP
User types: for the MVP there is just one user. All users can see all the posts. For later versions, government officials can have a different view or see additional analytics information.
